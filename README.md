## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information.
- Modeling the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
- The Regression model is showing a very good performance using the r_square as evaluation metric :
    - Train dataset : r_square_value : 0.9978537219277529
   - Test set r_square_value : 0.9899276000903947
- The most 3 features that explain well the regression model are :
   - Feature: registered, Score: 0.78683
   - Feature: casual, Score: 0.28184
   - Feature: weekday, Score: 0.00371
